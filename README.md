# CS300 Data Structures
This course covers some of the fundamental data structures as well as the algorithms operating on them. Topics included are: Introduction to theoretical aspects of computing: modeling algorithms and their run times, computational complexity. Linear data structures (lists, stacks, queues) trees (tries, binary search trees, AVL trees, treetraversals), hashing and hash tables, graphs and their representations, graph algorithms (depth first and breadth first search, single source shortest path algorithms), sorting algorithmic paradigms (divide and conquer, greedy, dynamic programming).
